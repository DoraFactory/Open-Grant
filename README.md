# Dora Factory Open Grant

The Open Grant program is designated to support developers to help build Dora Factory. The Open Grant supports infrastructures, tools, applications and on-chain governance research efforts based on Dora Factory.

This repo will be built up gradually as the guide for grant applications.

For now, if you are applying for a Dora Factory Open Grant, please submit a BUIDL on HackerLink at https://hackerlink.io/en/buidl, and describe goals, deliverables, milestones, and timelines of the project. After you submit the BUIDL, please send an email to steve@dorafactory.org, and schedule a date for screening.

The first batch of open grants will be funded on a case-by-case basis.

This repo will be developed over time, and the procedure of Open Grant application will also evolve over time.

Another source of funding is the Dora Factory Community Grant, hosted in the form of quadratic funding rounds on HackerLink. At this moment, the first round of Dora Factory Community Grant is live at https://hackerlink.io/en/grant/DAO%20Hack/1.

In general, the Open Grant supports projects that are "hard-core", and requires strict screening process and deliverable review. The community grant can support both tech-driven projects and community-driven projects (a project review process also applies), and funding will come from both community donations and the quadratic funding matching pool.
